This project, 'octupus', is a utility to control serial consoles remotely
via ssh connections. The features are:
    - Leverage libssh for ssh connections
    - Multiplex authenticated clients to uart consoles
    - Control connection to configure the UART settings

The deployment scenario it was developed for is to run as a cygwin process
to control multiple serial consoles (COM or USB serial) attached to a Windows
PC. The author works with embedded devices and has multiple serial ports that
need to be managed. This application provides a convenient and secure way to
establish a connection to those serial devices directly without using remote
desktop or VNC, etc.
